# List the things you added for points 
**REQUIRED:**
- More than 8 knots
- The major choices the player can make include:
- Taking the gem at the very beginning of the story, which dramatically alters the squid
  interaction at the end of the narrative
- You can choose to either lie to the squid about stealing the gem or not, this also
  changes his dialouge and can even lead to him eating you if you both lied and took 
  it
- Choices the player makes are reflected back in the forms of dialouge changes, avaible 
  items to pick up, and the outcome of the story. There are several endings that the 
  player can create based on their decisions.
- More than 1 loop
  
**EXTRA** 
- +2 Total of 58 Knots
- +1 Several items that can be picked up (gold coins, bottle containing directions, 
  golden statue)
- +1 Depending on where you've been and how many times, almost every passage's 
  description will change.
- Didn't include any "upgrades" but obtaining certain items makes the game easier than 
  playing otherwise. 

**MY FUN**
- 10 variables including items, player name, and how many times you've talked to certain 
  characters. These values will change your next interaction with them, so if you've 
  talked to them for the first time or the third time, they will have different 
  intentions.
- The Golden Shrimp statue, this item is harder to find, and was included at the request 
  of my best friend. Finding it and keeping it for the rest of the story adds challenge 
  to the game.
